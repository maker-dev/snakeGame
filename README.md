# 🐍 Snake Game  

A classic Snake game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

## 🎮 How to Play  
- Use **Arrow Keys (↑ ↓ → ←)** to control the snake.  
- **Eat the food (red square)** to grow longer.  
- **Avoid hitting the walls or yourself**—or it's game over!  
- The game keeps track of your **score** (each food = +1 point).  

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ **Keyboard controls** (Arrow Keys)  
✔️ **Score tracking**  
✔️ **Game Over detection** (wall collision & self-collision)
